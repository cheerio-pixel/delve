#+title: Reference2
#+roam_tags: tag1 tag2

This is just a blind text. 

The purpose of this note file is to provide another file with the tags
"tag1" and "tag2", allowing to test if duplicate tags are eliminated.

Another purpose is to test links.

So we have a [[file:reference.org][link]] to 'reference'.
