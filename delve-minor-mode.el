;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode to access some of delve's feature from within org roam.
;; Bind this minor mode to org roam, i.e. by using hooks.

;;; Code:
(require 'delve)

;; * Variables

(defvar delve-minor-mode-prefix-key (kbd "C-c d")
  "Prefix for delve minor mode keys.")

;; * Functions

(defun delve-minor-mode-maybe-activate ()
  "Turn on delve minor mode if current buffer is in org roam."
  (interactive)
  (when (and (buffer-file-name)
	     (org-roam--org-roam-file-p))
