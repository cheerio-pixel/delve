;;; Commentary:

;; Provides utilities for testing interaction with an org roam
;; database. Adopted from https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea.
;;
;; For these functions to work, a separate directory with org roam
;; note files has to be provided. It has to be accessed from this
;; file's location. See the variable "delve-note-files-directory".
